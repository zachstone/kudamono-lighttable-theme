Kudamono Theme
==========================

A very colorful theme designed for Clojure. Uses 6 carefully chosen colors and various shades of gray. When used with Clojure, every term is colored, which has the nice effect of being able to see some basic program structure at a glance.

I recommed not using the Rainbow plugin, as it makes this theme quite noisy. Also, these images are using the Ubuntu Mono font.
